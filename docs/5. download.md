# Download the Dataset

:::warning

WORK IN PROGRESS

The Verifier Alliance dataset is currently incomplete and does not contain all the verified contracts from all verifiers.
:::

The whole dataset is exported daily in [Parquet](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format), a modern column-based data format that is directly queryable and compressed. ([Quick tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/apache-parquet)). The parquet files are hosted at Cloudflare R2.

The latest dataset manifest is available at [export.verifieralliance.org](https://export.verifieralliance.org/) in JSON format.

The manifest contains each table under the `files` field. Each table is partitioned in a certain number of rows, depending on the size of the table. E.g. the `verified_contracts` table is partitioned in 1 million rows since each row is small, whereas the `sources` table is partitioned in 10,000 rows.

Following each entry in the array under the table names, one can download each partition. For example, the first partition of the `verified_contracts` table is available at [https://export.verifieralliance.org/verified_contracts/verified_contracts_0_1000000.parquet](https://export.verifieralliance.org/verified_contracts/verified_contracts_0_1000000.parquet).

The manifest looks like this:
