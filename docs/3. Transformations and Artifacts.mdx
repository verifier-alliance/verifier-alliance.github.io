Transformations and artifacts are outputs of smart‑contract compilation and verification. Compilation artifacts include interface objects such as the ABI and detailed compiler data like the storage layout. Transformations come from verification; applying them to compiled bytecode yields the onchain bytecode. The next section explains and defines the structure of transformations and artifacts.
