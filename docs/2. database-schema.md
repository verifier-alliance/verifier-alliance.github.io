# Database Schema

Verifier Alliance's database schema is in PostgreSQL and is intended to be a standard for storing and accessing verified smart contract data.

In essence every smart contract verification (`verified_contracts` table) is a mapping between a compilation (`compiled_contracts`) and a deployment (`contract_deployments`). In addition `verified_contracts` defines "transformations". These are changes need to be made on the **recompiled bytecode** to reach the **onchain bytecode**. Transformations can be replacements of non-executional parts of the bytecode (e.g. immutables, libraries, metadata) or insertions at the end such as constructor arguments. Read more about them in the [transformations docs](/docs/transformations).

For deduplicating the source files and the bytecode across verifications the schema also includes a `code` and `sources` table with hashes.
